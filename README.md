# bo3-campaign-decompiled
Campaign scripts decompiled intended for research on speedrunning strategies. Scripts were decompiled using cerberus. Scripts were hashed thanks to https://github.com/Jake-NotTheMuss/t7-hashes/blob/master/hashes.csv. If any new strategies are found let me know on discord Ndt#8844.
